# SlimeVR_to_Mobu_VMC_test
！！！This is a test of a Python script that connects SlimeVR with MotionBuilder 2025. This script is incomplete and contains many bugs. It works in an environment where pythonOSC is installed.

```python
pip install python-osc
```

 Please use slimeVR with Mirrortracking turned ON.
